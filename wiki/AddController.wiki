== Adding a new robot controller ==

Cellbots provides an IRobotControllerService Interface which developers must implement, in order to make their robot drivable through Cellbots. More specifically, a developer must 

 # Implement an Android Service which implements the interface. For example, take a look at the class com.cellbots.local.robotcontrollerservice.!DefaultRobotControllerService 
 # The service’s `<service>` declaration in the !AndroidManifest.xml file should contain an Action in the Intent filter with the name "com.cellbots.controller.ROBOT_CONTROLLER_SERVICE", by which Cellbots identifies the controller. Please see the !AndroidManifest.xml for Cellbots.
